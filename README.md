# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of School district data using Python

## Overview
After compiling the data for Py City Schools, it was discovered that the 9th grade scores in math and reading had been altered at Thomas High School.  While it is unknown the extent of the academic dishonesty, the Py City School Board has decided to proceed with the analysis without the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School.  After replacing all 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School with NaN, the following results were tallied.

- District Summary
- School Summary
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type
